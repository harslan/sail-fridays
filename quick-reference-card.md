## WEBSITE LINK (paste at 5:00)

```
🔗 Follow along here: https://harslan.github.io/sail-fridays/
```

## YOUR HOOK (memorize this)

> "Superhosts charge **$154 less** per night — but earn **$87/day vs. $62/day**. Elite hosts charging less but earning more. How?"

---

## BACKUP CHAT MESSAGE (if someone can't access site)

```
SAIL AUDIT Questions:
1. Which SAIL pillar is STRONGEST? What evidence?
2. Which pillar is WEAKEST or missing?
3. Pick ONE assignment — what small tweak could strengthen a weak pillar?
```

---

## DURING SILENT ANALYSIS

- **2:00 remaining:** "About halfway."
- **1:00 remaining:** "One minute left."
- **0:15 remaining:** "Finish your thought."
- **0:00:** "Time. Let's talk."

---

## EXPECTED FACULTY RESPONSES

**Strongest pillar:** AI Literacy
- *Your response:* "Right — AI tools required, prompts documented, comparison of AI vs. traditional."

**Weakest pillar:** Leadership/Ethics
- *They'll say:* "Assignment 3 — loan defaults with no ethics"
- *Your response:* "Exactly. Who gets credit, who gets denied — and no fairness discussion."

**Weakest pillar:** Social Intelligence
- *They'll say:* "No presentations, no audience adaptation"
- *Your response:* "All technical deliverables. Students never translate for non-technical stakeholders."

## IF SILENCE DURING SHAREOUT

Say: "Let me put it differently — did anything in the assignments make you uncomfortable?"

Or: "Assignment 3 has students building a loan approval model. What's missing?"

---

## YOUR TRANSITION TO DMITRI

> "You just did this manually in 4 minutes. What if you had a tool that could do it systematically — on YOUR syllabus? That's what Dmitri built. He's going to run it on this same syllabus so you can compare."

> "Dmitri — show us what you've got."

---

## REMEMBER

- **The silence is okay.** Let them think during the 4 minutes.
- **First share unlocks others.** If quiet, call on someone by name.
- **Assignment 3 is the gold.** If no one raises it, you raise it.
- **You know this cold.** Trust yourself.

**You've got this.**
