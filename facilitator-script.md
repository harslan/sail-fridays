## THE SCRIPT

---

### OPENING HOOK (0:00–3:00) — 3 minutes

**[Keep your camera on, no screen share yet]**

> "Before Dmitri shows you what we've built, I want you to experience what the SAIL framework actually *does* — not as a concept, but as a lens you can apply right now."

> "Quick grounding for anyone who missed our November sessions: SAIL came from watching what happens when we give students authentic complexity."

**[Pause — lean in slightly]**

> "In our Prompt AIChemy competition, students were analyzing Boston Airbnb data. One finding stopped me cold."

> "Superhosts — Airbnb's elite tier — charge $154 *less* per night than regular hosts."

**[Pause for effect]**

> "But they earn $87 per day versus $62 for regular hosts. Elite hosts charging *less* but earning *more*. How?"

> "The students who cracked it — whether they used Python or AI prompting — all did the same things. They defined success multi-dimensionally. They questioned assumptions. They investigated surprising patterns. They considered who wins and who loses."

> "That's SAIL. Not because we told them to check four boxes, but because the question *demanded* it."

---

### FRAMEWORK FLASH (3:00–5:00) — 2 minutes

> "Four pillars, four questions. You'll use these in a moment."

**[You can briefly hold up four fingers or just speak clearly]**

> "**S — Social Intelligence:** Who needs to hear this, and how do I reach them?"

> "**A — AI Literacy:** What can AI do here, and what are its limits?"

> "**I — Innovation and Inquiry:** What's missing, surprising, or potentially wrong?"

> "**L — Leadership:** Should we do this, and who's affected by our choices?"

> "The goal isn't to hit all four in every assignment. It's to *notice* which ones you're activating — and which might be missing."

---

### EXERCISE SETUP (5:00–7:00) — 2 minutes

> "Here's what we're going to do. First, let me share a link in the chat."

**[Paste in chat NOW:]**

```
🔗 Follow along here: https://harslan.github.io/sail-fridays/
```

> "This site has everything — the SAIL framework, the syllabus we'll analyze, and a timer. Pull it up on your device so you can scroll through at your own pace."

**[Give 15 seconds for people to open it]**

> "Scroll down to the Exercise section. You'll see a sample syllabus — Business Analytics Fundamentals. It's not anyone's actual course. I designed it to be professionally competent but imperfect in interesting ways."

> "You'll see three questions on the right side of the screen. Take four minutes to scan the syllabus through the SAIL lens."

**[Paste questions in chat as backup:]**

```
SAIL AUDIT Questions:
1. Which SAIL pillar is STRONGEST? What evidence?
2. Which pillar is WEAKEST or missing?
3. Pick ONE assignment — what small tweak could strengthen a weak pillar?
```

> "Four minutes. Just scan and jot your impressions. Don't overthink it. We'll discuss what you noticed."

> "Ready? Four minutes starts now."

**[Start your timer. STAY QUIET.]**

---

### SILENT ANALYSIS (7:00–11:00) — 4 minutes

**[Keep syllabus on screen. Say nothing for the first 2 minutes.]**

**At 2:00 remaining:**
> "About halfway. Keep scanning."

**At 1:00 remaining:**
> "One minute left."

**At 0:15 remaining:**
> "Wrapping up — finish your thought."

**At 0:00:**
> "Time. Let's talk about what you saw."

---

### SHAREOUT & DISCUSSION (11:00–17:00) — 6 minutes

**[Stop screen share OR keep syllabus visible — your choice]**

> "I'm curious what you noticed. No need for a polished answer — just what caught your attention."

> "First question: Which pillar did you see as *strongest* in this syllabus?"

**[Wait for responses. Call on someone if silence. Likely answers: AI Literacy]**

**Affirm and build:**
- If they say AI Literacy: *"Right — AI tools are required, prompts are documented, there's even a comparison of AI vs. traditional approaches. That's solid."*

> "Now the harder question: Which pillar is *weakest* or missing?"

**[This is where it gets interesting. Likely answers:]**

**If they say Leadership/Ethics:**
> "Tell me more — what specifically concerned you?"

*[They'll likely mention Assignment 3 — loan default prediction with no ethics discussion]*

> "Exactly. Students are building a model that determines who gets credit and who gets denied. The assignment asks them to 'maximize accuracy' and 'minimize false negatives.' No mention of fairness, bias, or who's affected by these predictions. That's a Leadership gap — and it's significant."

**If they say Social Intelligence:**
> "What did you notice?"

*[They'll likely mention that all deliverables are technical — notebooks, reports, dashboards — with no audience adaptation]*

> "Right. There's no presentation, no memo to executives, no translation for non-technical stakeholders. Students analyze data but never practice communicating it to different audiences. That's Social Intelligence — completely missing."

**If they mention the healthcare data (Assignment 2):**
> "Good catch. Patient wait times, treatment outcomes — and no discussion of privacy, appropriate use, or limitations of what this data can and can't tell us."

**[Try to get 3-4 faculty to share. Keep it moving. You have 6 minutes total for this section.]**

> "One more question: Did anyone identify a specific tweak for one of the assignments?"

**[Take 1-2 responses. Affirm creative solutions.]**

**Sample affirmations:**
- *"That's exactly the kind of small change that activates a whole new pillar."*
- *"Notice how that doesn't require redesigning the assignment — just reframing the deliverable."*
- *"You just turned a technical exercise into a leadership exercise with one sentence."*

### TRANSITION TO DMITRI (17:00–20:00) — 3 minutes

> "What you just did in four minutes — scanning a syllabus through the SAIL lens — is valuable. You identified gaps. You saw opportunities. You brought your expertise."

> "But it's also manual. You had to hold the framework in your head and apply it yourself."

**[Pause]**

> "What if you had a tool that could do this systematically? That could read your syllabus — or any syllabus — identify where each SAIL pillar shows up, and suggest where AI-enabled experiences might strengthen the gaps?"

> "That's exactly what Dmitri built. And he's going to run it on *this same syllabus* — so you can see how the agent's analysis compares to what you just identified."

> "Dmitri — show us what you've got."

**[Hand off. You're done.]**

---

## BACKUP: IF SHAREOUT IS SLOW

If faculty are quiet, have these prompts ready:

- "Let me ask it differently — did anything in the assignments make you uncomfortable? Anything you'd do differently?"

- "I'll share what I noticed: Assignment 3 has students building a loan approval model. What's missing from that prompt?"

- "Who teaches something with a similar structure? What would YOU do differently?"

---

## BACKUP: IF SHAREOUT RUNS LONG

If discussion is rich and you're running over:

- At 16:00: "This is great — I want to let Dmitri show you the tool. One more quick thought and we'll transition."

- At 18:00: "Perfect segue to Dmitri. Let's see how the agent handles this same syllabus."

---

## THE KEY MOMENTS

**Moment 1 — The Hook:** The -$154 finding. Say it with genuine surprise. This is interesting!

**Moment 2 — The Silence:** During the 4-minute analysis, STAY QUIET. Let them think. The temptation to fill silence is strong. Resist it.

**Moment 3 — The First Share:** If the first faculty member shares, others will follow. If silence, call on someone you know: "Maria, what did you notice?"

**Moment 4 — The Loan Default Discussion:** This is the richest gap. If faculty don't raise it, you raise it: "Did anyone look at Assignment 3? What's being asked — and what's NOT being asked?"

**Moment 5 — The Transition:** Connect their manual analysis to Dmitri's automated version. "You just did this by hand. Now watch what a trained agent can do with the same syllabus."

---

## YOU'VE GOT THIS

You know this material cold. You built the framework. You've seen it work with students. Now you're helping colleagues see what you see.

The exercise respects their expertise. The syllabus has real gaps worth discussing. The handoff to Dmitri is natural.

Trust the design. Trust yourself.

Let's go.
